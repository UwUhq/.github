# Security policy

We take security very seriously at UwUhq and are open to security reports.  
If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact us privately on Discord ([discord.gg/UwUhq](https://discord.gg/UwUhq)).  
If needed, we will set up a secure communication channel to exchange details about the security vulnerability.  
**Do not use repository issues to report security vulnerabilities.**

We are committed to providing a quick response to security reports and to maintaining full transparency in the security issue disclosure process.  
Security issues will be announced once fixed using GitHub Security Advisories.

Thank you for helping make UwUhq safer!
